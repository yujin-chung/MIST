MIST copyright 2016 by Yujin Chung and Jody Hey


MIST has been written using the OpenMPI-C++ framework, and can be compiled using standard MPI favors of the GNU compiler (including mpicc and mpicxx). OpenMPI must be installed. Also once installed, please make sure that the ``bin'' directory of OpenMPI is added to your machine's path.

Then compile the software with this command.

mpicxx -std=c++11 *.cpp *.cc -o MIST


If your machine has different compiler versions, for example c++0x, then use this command.

mpicxx -std=c++0x *.cpp *.cc -o MIST

This will compile program MIST. 


** Note on Aug 17, 2016 **
std::binder2nd that Eigen uses is deprecated and you may have warning messages when it is compiled. You can temporarily get rid of the warnings with the -Wno-deprecated-declarations flag. For example, see below:

mpicxx -std=c++11 -Wno-deprecated-declarations *.cpp *.cc -o MIST
