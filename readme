MIST copyright 2016 by Yujin Chung and Jody Hey


MIST has been written using the OpenMPI-C++ framework, and can be compiled using standard MPI flavors of the GNU compiler (including mpicc and mpicxx). OpenMPI must be installed. Also once installed, please make sure that the ``bin'' directory of OpenMPI is added to your machine's path.

Then compile the software with this command.

mpicxx -std=c++11 *.cpp *.cc -o MIST


If your machine has different compiler versions, for example c++0x, then use this command.

mpicxx -std=c++0x *.cpp *.cc -o MIST

This will compile program MIST.
